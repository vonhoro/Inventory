# Inventory
An inventory page
This website was made with the intention of learning how to use express to set up a server with mongo db, because of that t is possible to create/delete/edit entries on the different pages.

I also used this project to learn about react router, how to create a rest api, upload images and all that. Other important thing is that I used blueprintjs for my UI, being that the first time I use something of that nature, it is also my first project using sass.

The last thing is I am using the useContext hook of react to handle global variables in this case you can change your user by clicking on the buttons, each user has different priviledge an options, though, because they are general, there is not back end implemented on them.
